# NbaTeamsDatabase
This application maintains a database of basketball teams in the NBA which stores information pertaining to the managers, the coach, and the players. 
Since this is a relational database it also tracks the relationships between entities and the attributes that are relevant. \
In the java source code I have also hard coded some sample queries that I have used to extract meaningful information to draw conclusions from the data.
